    <h1>Venus</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is named after the Roman 
    goddess of love and beauty. As the second-brightest natural object in the 
    night sky after the Moon, Venus can cast shadows and, rarely, is visible to 
    the naked eye in broad daylight. Venus lies within Earth's orbit, and so 
    never appears to venture far from the Sun, setting in the west just after 
    dusk and rising in the east a bit before dawn. Venus orbits the Sun every 
    224.7 Earth days.</p>
